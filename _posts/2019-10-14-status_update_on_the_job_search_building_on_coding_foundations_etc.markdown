Further adventures in the life of a budding web developer: installment the latest of many.  Perhaps the biggest challenge I'm facing, after several months post-graduation, is keeping up the skills I built while at Flatiron.  A full time job and all the obligations of adult life make it difficult to continue coding while also maintaining a job search.  Such is the life of a career transitioner, but the daily struggles are what make us stronger, more resilient, and more creative people.  So what's going on in the career search?

Over the past few weeks, Glassdoor has become my job board of choice when it comes to tracking down work, and I strongly recommend it as the number one resource for bootcamp grads.  It's made job hunting significantly easier for a number of reasons: Glassdoor is easy to use, with a beautifully designed interface, consistent email notifications re: newly posted local jobs, and followup emails re: jobs I've already applied for.  The application process is somewhat more streamlined than that of similar job boards, and it also provides past and current employees' ratings of each listed company. Best yet, it's as valuable a resource as LinkedIn, with the added advantage of being 100% free.

In terms of skills building, other great resources have been freeCodeCamp and Codewars, the first helping me maintain my knowledge, and the second challenging my ability to write clean algorithims to solve problems of varying complexities.

As the job search continues, I'm battling the frustration of not having landed that first job just yet, but of course that was to be expected.  Glassdoor has assisted greatly in helping me be more proactive in applying for jobs, and with luck, I'll have some exciting news about a job offer in the next couple of weeks!
