The hardest part of any job search is dealing with the (almost) inevitable rejection.  Yes, there are times when great job offers appear out of the blue -- but it's important to recognize that, without a strong personal network, this probably isn't going to happend for a new coder.

More importantly, acknowledge that jobs *never* just land in your lap.   In my previous career as a sculptor, it took years of networking, study, and multiple contacts with my dream employer before -- just "out of the blue" -- they got in touch with a job offer.  In retrospect, I invested a lot into getting the job, but, spread out over several years, it didn't feel like I'd expended much energy at all. 

It's true that I landed my dream job by working my way up in the industry.  It's true that landing that first job opens doors that don't exist for a total noob.  It's true that hunting for work can be exhausting, nerve-racking, ego-busting, and tedious.  

BUT.  It's also true that rejection is a positive, albeit, unwanted outcome of the job search.  There's the obvious benefit of learning something about your flaws and strengths as a prospective employee, as well as getting a handle on what employers are looking for.  What's not so obvious is where meeting these people will take you.  

actually interviewed for my dream job multiple times prior to being hired. I was roundly rejected on my first interview, but, as a result, I was able to meet up with the company designer several times to discuss his work.  Later, I was contacted by the owner of the company, seeking referrals for skilled artists for a project he was working on.  It wasn't until a year later that I was actually offered a permanent position there.

The takeaway here is that you can't anticipate or even necessarily know what seeds you'll plant just by reaching out and getting rejected.  Stay positive, keep sending out those resumes and following up on interviews!
