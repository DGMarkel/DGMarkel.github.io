As my job search progresses, my focus has been on getting my foot in the door as soon as possible.  I don't want to lose the skills I've built over a year studing at Flatiron, and any experience is good experience when you're just starting out, right?  A job offer this past week changed my view on things, so I want to take a minute to discuss unpaid internships, which is what I was offered.

On the face of it, an 8-week unpaid internship has many benefits. If I wasn't clear, this is the first solid job offer I've received.  The pros: a low-risk entry to the web-dev world, with ample opportunity to meet with mentors, study new frameworks, and expand my network, as well as the possibility of a paid position at the end of it.  The cons: surviving in New York for 8 weeks with no income, and no guarantee of a paid position at the end of the internship.  To be clear, this isn't something I can afford.  I've reached out to my interviewer about arranging an alternate internship plan, and we may still go forward with the internship if we can work something out.

Other than that tiny little issue, a lot of red flags were raised during my interview.  These, more than anything else, will be valuable to me moving forward with other interviews.  I'll briefly outline these issues below:

* The interview was much shorter -- about 30 minutes, total -- than any I've had at other companies.  That may be because the internship is unpaid, and carries little risk for the employer.  On the other hand, I felt I didn't have enough time to feel out the position or the interviewer.
* I only met my interviewer, and not in person.  Because our interview was carried out over the phone, I was unable to meet any other employees or interns, see the office, meet with my potential mentor, etc.  In other words, I had no opportunity to be the interviewer; only the interviewee.
* I was offered a position, but not a written job offer.  That magical question, "When can you start?" felt strangely unsatisfying to hear.

This internship could be a great opportunity, but after an unsatisfactory interview process, I feel like I have to go with my gut.  The two main takeaways are this: first, make sure to interview your employer at least as much as they are interviewing you; take the time to get all the information you need.  Second, try to meet multiple people at the company, and go there physically if you can!
