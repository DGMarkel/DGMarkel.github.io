I arrived at coding from a strange place, but really, you could say that about any of the career paths I've pursued.  My professional trajectory is nothing near a straight line: from legal writer to pastry cook to sculptor.  But there are many threads tying all those career choices together.  Two of the most important are creativity and crafstmanship: the ability to realize my creative potential through hundreds of hours of practice.   I'm proud to have created  products that others can use, see, or consume, and, hopefully, enjoy.

How are sculpting, writing, and cooking like coding?  That's a question I couldn't have answered a few months ago.  I started coding pretty much on a lark, in between jobs and looking for new skills to add to my resume.  I was immediately struck by how familiar it felt, almost as if all the skills I'd already built were leading up to this new, completely unexpected  career trajectory.

If you ask someone what a sculptor does, they'd tell you what anyone would: that they make sculptures.  Which is true, up to a point.  But ninety percent of the work a sculptor *actually* does is invisible: consulting with clients and designers; researching materials, tools, and historical precedents; sketching out ideas and proposal drawings; budgeting for expenses and time; and, sculpting, and then mold makng, casting, and installation.    So the skills one needs to be a sculptor, it turns out, often have very little to do with sculpting itself.  And it turns out that what I enjoy most, in sculpture, in writing, in cooking, is the logistics of a project.  

Coding almost exactly mirrors design logistics in any of those fields.  Let's say I want to make a statue.  After I decide on a general design, the first thing I do is research, research, research.  Has anyone made something like this before?  How did they solve the design problems that I'll be dealing with?  How can I use their solutions to make my design better? Next, I establish all of the tools and materials I need to complete my project.  If I don't have the tools I think I might need, I can either buy them or build them.  (Most sculptors like to build their own tools, and each projects' custom tools are as fascinating as the sculptures themselves).  I budget out my time, usually in hours, for each stage of the project, and try to identify areas where I can cut down on my effort.  I stick to that budgeted schedule as much as possible, but take a step back every day or two, just to make sure that its logic is there, that everything is progressing on time and in the way I expected it to.   Of course, it almost never does, which is where creative problem solving comes in.  You find yourself saying: "This isn't working the way I wanted it to, but I still have this deadline to make.  What am I going to do make this work?  What can I borrow from other projects in my studio?  Who do I know that's dealt with this problem before?"

In the past ten years at least, I've worked in studios and restaurants where the nearest computer was at least a floor away.  Many of my career decisions were motivated by a desire to stay as far away from computers as possible.  So I was pretty surprised to feel those same creative gears turning when I sat down to code for the first time.    It was like someone turning a light on where there hadn't ever been one.  All the intellectual fulfillment that I just wasn't quite getting as an artist or cook was suddenly there.  

And so as I opened, so shall I close: let the adventure begin.
