I'm a visually-oriented person looking to build beautifully organized UIs.  While it's important to me to understand the full stack, what I really care about is deploying sites that function well on the client side.  When I prep for interviews, I spend most of my time  has boning up on what I care about: frontend concepts, especially concerning Javascript, React, and Redux.  But it's just not working out for me.  I stumble on core backend concepts, and that sure doesn't look good to interviewers!

Two things: first, I'm not necesarrily interviewing for the right roles.  As someone without any professional coding experience, that's just something I need to do.  Second, if I want to get my foot in the door, I'm going to need to bone up on some absolute basic concepts in web development.  

So, to answer the question What's a server? as simply as possible, in the context of an interview:

In simplest terms, a web server is a computer that is connected to the internet and stores web server software and all of a website's component parts.  A client, or browser, on the user end can make HTTP requests to that server to display a website.  The server can either be static or dynamic.  Static servers send data that users cannot modify in any way.  Dynamic servers are connected to application software and a database.  Users can interact with the database by submitting form data and editing and deleting data they have permission to update.
