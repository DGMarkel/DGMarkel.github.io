I’m going to keep this brief:  as a new web developer looking to land that first job, the most important thing to focus on is your ability to learn.  The conversation circled back to this over and over again: companies want to hire coders who A, love to learn, B, are willing to learn, and C, haven’t developed too many bad habits already.  You don’t need to know everything already, but you do need to display intelligence and flexibility by asking questions, aptly discussing what your knowledge while also being honest about gaps in that knowledge.  If a difficult coding question comes up, offer the best answer you can, and then ask your interviewer how they would attack the problem.  Interviewing can be an educational experience.  Even if you don’t land that job, know that your access to professional coders is still a great benefit.

Questions to ask:
	How do you see your product evolving in the next six months?
	What version of x framework are you using, and will you be updating to a newer version or moving to a new framework?
	How long have you been using this framework? 
	Tell me about your site architecture/can I speak to one of your engineers about it?

Points to consider:
	If a company is migrating to a new framework or updating to a newer version that I am familiar with, I can offer to train employees.
