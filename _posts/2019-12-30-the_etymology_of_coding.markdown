Happy holidays to all!  For this holiday season, I want to share a fascinating aspect of coding that speaks deeply to my deeply nerdy heart: the etymological origins of the word "code."  I was fascinated to learn, thanks to one of my favorite podcasts, "A History of the English Language," that code is an ancient word that, believe it or not, actually means a block of wood.  

In Europe, texts were written not on parchment, paper, or vellum, but on literal tree trunks!  The latin caudex, Anglicized to codex, again originally referred to a block of wood.  In Roman times, texts were often scribed, or "encoded," on blocks of wood covered in a light wax coating. 

Who would've thunk that a modern word like "coding" would refer all the way back to the Roman practice of scratching text into a waxed hunk of wood?  The more you know.
