I recently graduated from Flatiron's Online Web Development course, and I'm ready and raring to go on landing that first job.  In the course of my first few interviews, though, it's become apparent that while I'm *definitely* comfortable coding, technical talk is a weak spot. I have a background in various creative fields, where I'm used to working on team projects. Communication with other artists, designers, architects, and sometimes even the press, is a constant part of the job. I'm moving into an entirely new field, and while many of my skills will carry over, technical discussion in coding can sometimes feel like a foreign language that I'm not entirely fluent in.  Coding jargon is more stringently technical than any I've used before.  The following is an outline of the ways in which I plan to gain fluency in programmer's jargon.

# Weekly Blog Posts on Coding Basics

I understand fundamental coding concepts in Ruby and Javascript -- the two languages I've learned at Flatiron. I'm not always able to define them clearly and concisely.  As I prepare for my first job, I'll need to revisit those basics until I have them down cold.  Using popular technical interview questions as my guide, I'll write at least one blog post a week on these basic concepts.

# Attending Weekly Meetups 

The best way to gain fluency in any language is practice, practice, practice!  Since my schooling was completed online, now is the time to get out there and immerse myself in techical talks at every opportunity.

# Improved Precision in Communication

Professionally, I've chosen to work behind the scenes -- as a writer, an artist at design studios, and a cook in restaurant kitchens. I have a front-facing service job for the first time. I view this as a great opportunity to focus on my communication skills with the public.  As part of my ongoing professional developing, I'm paying more attention to the quality of my communication as I educate customers on the products my company sells.

# Scheduling Mock Technical Interviews
Within the next week or two, I plan on nailing down a list of contacts in my personal network who may be able to help me practice talking about code out loud.  I'll also investigate meetups and paid oportunities to practice interviewing. 

# To Be Continued...
Obviously, there are many other areas I plan on addressing, i.e., continuing to build out past projects, actually looking for jobs, completely daily coding challenges, etc.  I'm looking forward to following up here as my quest to land that first job continues!
