I spent most of that Thursday night  tangled in sheets, fumbling through app ideas like the desperate developer I was.  But lo, what the dawn brings: the spark of an idea, courtesy of Facebook, thank you very much.

A former employer - and one of my favorite sculptors - announced that she'd just won a commission to create the first statue of an historical female figure in Central Park.  Ten minutes later, the New York Times published an article listing reader suggestions for additional memorials to famous female influencers.  

As it turns out, Mayor de Blasio administration is making a significant push to add to the diversity of public monuments here.  She Built NYC is First Lady Shirlane McCray's initiative to redress the dearth of public monuments to women, women's organizations, and historical events significant to women's issues in New York City. 

I've worked as a sculptor and architectural restorationist for the past five years, and spend much of my free time studying and sketching monuments around the city.  I've had the opportunity to work on public monuments in the city, and my restoration work is in many civic, commercial, and private buildings in the area.  Building a website to support She Built NYC seemed like a fantastic tie-in to my professional background.

While [She Built NYC](https://women.nyc/she-built-nyc/) has already been developed to collect nominations for prominent female figures from the public, I decided to design my own version of the site, with the hope that I could donate it to the campaign on its completion.  Unfortunately, the window for nominations closed before I finished my project, but I'm pleased to have produced a site with so much personal relevance.
