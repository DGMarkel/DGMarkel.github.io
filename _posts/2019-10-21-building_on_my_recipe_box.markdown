It's been a few months since finishing my final portfolio project for Flatiron School, My Recipe Box.  I've finally got it deployed to the web, and it's time to roll up my shirt sleeves and build out some more features. It's an exciting place to be! I'm looking forward to fleshing out what I think is a really strong concept.  My aim is to build  a personal nutritional tracker that I can use on a daily basis.

Just to recap, My Recipe Box is a React/Redux app with a Ruby on Rails backend.  It's a nutritional tracker designed specifically for adventurous home cooks like me. I tend to write my own recipes on the daily, and if not, I'll at least add some flair to any given recipe I'm looking at.  

As I was finishing up the project, I published a limited set of goals for future features.  I discussed two basic themes for development: first, building a limited social network, wherein users can like, comment on, share, and potentially contribute to others’ recipes.  Second, adding the ability to save other users’ recipes and edit them to suit individual dietary concerns. 

Now that it's been a few months, there are a few concerns I'd like to address prior to jumping on those two listed above.  The most pressing is the addition of some kind of site management functionality.  Now that the site is actually online, it's important to add admin permissions so that I can manually moderate the backend when necessary.  This should be a simple fix, and one that I plan on implementing immediately.  I'd also like to spend some more time on the UI; possibly by reworking it completely.  I'm fairly happy with the first run of my front end, but it feels a bit basic.  I plan on taking a few free online courses in UI to gain a better feel for how professionals develop custom user interfaces.  This is a consideration that will take considerable time, and I plan on posting more about this in future blog posts.

That's more than enough work for one week.  Again, I'll continue to post about this project as I build it out.  In the meantime, I'd love it if you'd take a look and [try out my site](https://dgmarkel.github.io/recipe-box-client/#/)!
