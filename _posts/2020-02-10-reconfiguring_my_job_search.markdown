I started off my job search with a bang: getting flown out for an interview within a few weeks of graduating Flatiron's online course.  Since then, though, the job search has been more of a...let's not call it a whimper, shall we?...but a letdown, to be sure.  A key aspect of this, of course, is that entry to a new field can be daunting -- well, *is* daunting to me -- and I'm not generally the sort of person to dive headfirst into anything as new and scary as a total career makeover.  I like to dip my toes in to see if the water's fine, first.  And of course it is.

Of course it is.  But I jumped into web development without a clear sense of my end goal: what type of work would I want, what type of jobs would I pursue, etc.?  So in the past few months, I've applied to jobs with no clear sense of purpose, and I think it shows.  So here we are, in 2020, and it's time to, you know, like, be a brand new me?  2020, everyone! New years resolutions and all that.

So here's where we are: no more applying to jobs just because my skills match.  I know exactly who I am, professionally, and I know exactly the type of environment I want to work in.  I'm visually focused with organizational skills to match.  I enjoy working in small, close-knit teams.  I like having a hand in every aspect of a project.  I like the big picture view as much as getting lost in the small details.  

So I'm thinking...UX & front-end, mainly, at (hopefully) quirky startups.  Since I studied full stack, that means revamping my resume and building a portfolio of tightly edited, visually forward projects.  I've already got a couple under my belt, but it's time to push the buck.  

Here's a to some renewed excitement in the new year, baby!
