# What Is It?

Recipe Box is a nutritional tracker geared specifically towards home cooks who like to write their own recipes and experiment with others.  As someone who cooks every day and uses nutritional trackers on a daily basis, tracking my diet has become a time-consuming process.  I set out to design an app that is more user-friendly, more design-oriented, and less time-consuming than the ones I currently use.    
# What's Different About it?
The app relies on Nutritionix' natural language API for its nutritional data. This allows users to write or copy recipes into Recipe Box in natural language.  Nutritional data for each ingredient can be previewed in a single data table before a new recipe is saved.  This is something I haven't come across in other nutritional trackers.  

The interface is clean and presents data in a focused, obvious way.   Unlike other nutritional trackers, recipes also display like blog posts rather than as a simple series of graphs and tables.  I often get frustrated with how little thought seems to go into displaying the information I want to see.  With that in mind, I based my interface on popular food blogs like Serious Eats and Food52.

Recipes are searchable by ingredient: users can quickly access their own recipes by search; and all recipes on the backend are publically available to search.  While this is true of all nutritional trackers, I focused on presentation pretty heavily.

# What's Next For the App?
While all recipes are available to the public, Recipe Box is currently a single-purpose app focused solely on displaying caloric information and macro-nutrients for each recipe.  As I continue to build the app out, it will become a limited social network, wherein users can like, comment on, save, share, and potentially contribute to others' recipes. 

One particular focus as I move forward will be the ability to save other users' recipes and edit them to suit individual dietary concerns.  While this is already possible, I'd like to streamline the process so that users don't have to copy and paste existing recipes into a new recipe form.
