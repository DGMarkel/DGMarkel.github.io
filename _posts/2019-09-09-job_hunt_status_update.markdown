Well, it's officially been a month since my job search started, and things are going surprisingly well, considering that I'm working full-time, studying web development, attending coding meetups and hunting for jobs all at the same time.  

Jumping into the job search was a bit of a struggle for me.  After years of working in the arts, where paid jobs can be few and far between and competition forthose  jobs is stiff, I was feeling a lot of anxiety over just sending out my resume. I had very little confidence that it would be easy to land interviews as a new graduate of an online web development course.  I couldn't have been more wrong.

And on that note...to be to continued.
