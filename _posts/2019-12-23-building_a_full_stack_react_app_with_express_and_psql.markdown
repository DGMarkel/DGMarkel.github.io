I've been working on a custom version of a blog my family created over the course of several years.  Just as with my final project at Flatiron, I started the project with three full-on apps, including a backend, a content management system, and a front-facing app for public consumption.  Just as with that final project, it all felt a bit clunky.  I've come across Express before, but hadn't taken the opportunity to explore it as a backend in a more streamlined, better structured project.  

I'm following along with freecodecamps outstanding tutorial on how to build  full stack react app.  It's a fantastic series, and goes seriously deep into the working of such an app.  If you'd like to build your own custom blog, I recommend you[ follow the tutorial as well](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fullstack-react-blog-app-with-express-and-psql/).  I'll post updates as I continue to build the blog out.  This will be my first collaborative project, as I build on feedback from my family members, so it should be an exciting build.
