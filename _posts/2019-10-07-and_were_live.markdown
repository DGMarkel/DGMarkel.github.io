If you're looking for a job in web development, you're probably going to want to have a portfolio.  And if you're a bootcmp graduate, that probably means you've got a bunch of projects under your belts, but none of them are live.  So while you've already got a github profile full of repos, you're going to want to prove your design mettle along with your coding proficiency.  Here, I'll be outlining how to move your project from local repo or git clone to an actual live, globally accessible app.
