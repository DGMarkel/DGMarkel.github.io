Like so many of us, I often struggle to maintain a healthy work life balance.  I've spent most of my professional life in creative fields, where tight deadlines, budgets and staff have sometimes meant 70-80 hour work weeks for a month or more.  There's a lot to be said for this in the short term: the comraderie of a tightknit team; the chance to test one's limits, discover untapped strengths, and find pride in a job succesfully completed.  But projects have deadlines, and the arts being what they are, there's typically a lot of time to relax in between the big pushes.

There's something different about learning to code.  It's easy to get lost in the ever-changing, vast world of web development. Recently, I found myself at an impasse, where the need to study, produce, and search for jobs put my productivity at an utter standstill.  I was lost.  I felt like I needed to be working every free minute.   In the end, I was too overwhelmed to get any work done at all.

It took me a few weeks to get back on my feet.  I've put together a game plan that takes my personal needs into account as much as my professional needs.  The most important aspect of this is setting achieveable daily milestones - like completing a lesson in Wes Bos' Javascript30 course -- rather than trying to tackle ambitious projects that could be weeks or months in development.  

So far, this has worked like a charm.  I'm actually accomplishing something every day, or at least most days of the week.  Rather than that panicky feeling that I haven't gotten anything done at all, I'm building on the lessons of the day before, little by little.

Rules of the game:

No more than two hours a day of actual coding, unless I'm immersed in a project and don't want to stop.

At least a half hour of study in Javascript or React -- right now, reading articles on Medium, and especially those published on freeCodeCamp.

Sending out at least two job applications a day, or networking to some extent.

If nothing else, listening to a web dev podcast on my morning commute.
