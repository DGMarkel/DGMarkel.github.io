I'm transitioning into web development with a lot of career wins under my belt.  I'm proud of my accomplishments as an artist and craftsman. I'm also pretty sure that, coming into web development from a creative, non-traditional background, I've got a lot to offer.  But after several months of sending out resumes with very few bites, I know I need to recalibrate my job search approach.  I know I'm a skilled and creative designer with experience to win me a job -- but how best to display my achievements?
