Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak with an experienced frontend coder for several hours.  Fantastic.  I’m transitioning into web development from a field where computers are basically non-existent, so it was a real pleasure to get a seasoned developer's perspective on the trade.  I’m always impressed by how open-source coding culture -- not just the code itself -- really is.  This gentleman was no exception to that rule.  He was happy to share his experience, as well as any job opportunities coming his way -- bonus! We covered many topics, but the dominant theme of the talk was networking and the interview process.

# It Never Hurts to Ask

This was a common thread running through our conversation.  We’re all human, and like most humans, I’m a bit apprehensive when it comes to asking for help of any kind.  Yet over and over again, the idea of asking for help came up.  Reach out to the experts; reach out to CTOs and engineers and recruiters; reach out to friends, family, and the people you follow on twitter.  You never know who’ll be willing to help, or who might have a job lead.

# Following on That Thought

What if you already have a connection to the job you’re looking for and don’t even know it?  I’m applying to dozens of jobs through boards like Glassdoor, but there are hundreds of applicants per job.  What I need to do, and one of the prime areas where the gentleman I spoke with can help, is to see if he has an in at any of these jobs.  If you have anyone who can vouch for you, and can contact someone at the company directly, you’re far more likely to get that interview -- even if you have very little experience.

This is where a site like Linkedin comes in.  I can’t email my contacts with “hey, do you know someone at this company” literally every time I send out an application.  That would be madness.  But with Linkedin, it’s easy to scroll through their connections to see if they already know someone.

Networking is a multi-pronged adventure: leveraging our existing network of friends, maintaining a blog, attending conferences and meetups, listening to podcasts, following companies, teachers and friends on social platforms like twitter, etc.  I’m going to assume that anyone who’s been looking to get their foot in the door already knows this.  The real value of my conversation yesterday was in avenues I either hadn’t considered or haven’t made much of an effort to engage with.

## Twitter

I’m just going to come out and say it: I’ve never used Twitter.  I know this is probably a no-brainer to most of you, but having worked in tech-absent industries for most of my adult life, it just never occurred to me that twitter is a relatively passive way to not just network, but also to learn about the latest tech, find out about job openings, meetups, conferences, etc.  Rather than trying to network on my own, I can rely on a greater community of coders to bring news to me.  

## Public Slack Channels

This literally never would have crossed my mind.  I know Slack is a popular work tool, but the idea of public coding channels on Slack?  Pure gold.

## Podcasts

I work full time in New York, which means I commute full time as well.  Not having much time to code, podcasts are likely the best resource I have to build on my web dev skills without spending literally every minute of the day either working or studying.  I may devote a full blog post to podcasts as I build on my list of favorites.  For now, this:

## Conferences

As an aspiring web developer, living in New York offers a lot of advantages when it comes to conferences: ixnay on airfare, hotels, and the costs of eating out.  On the other hand, as an aspiring web developer, I, and you, probably can’t afford the price of admission anyway.  Is a two day conference worth the price of admission?  Debatable.  We discussed the possibility of lowered pay scales: asking for individual, rather than company rates on tickets, or admission for a single day of talks rather than for the full conference.  Still, with talks being posted on Youtube for free, and weekly/monthly meetups, even the advantages of networking at large conferences might not be worth the cost.  Which brings us to...

## Youtube

For me, an underutilized resource, mainly because video is more time consuming than reading the same material.  Brilliant suggestion?  Watch the videos at 3x speed.  Suggested sources of content? Mainly Google.  Given the relationships Youtube channels can foster between producers and viewers, this has some potential to be a potent networking resource...to be continued at some later date.
