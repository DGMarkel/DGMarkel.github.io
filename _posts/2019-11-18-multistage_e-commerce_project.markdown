A good friend of mine owns a Middle-Eastern catering/dry goods store.  I offered to build a website for her company at the beginning of my course at Flatiron.  Now that I have the skills to do so, I'm planning on doing a few dry runs of varying complexity.  Over the next several weeks, I plan on building out a series of e-commerce sites to get some practice in.

Obviously, the main task of any e-commerce site is to sell things online.  Since that's not something I have any experience in, I'm going to need to identify the correct means to do so.  Understandably, that will take some time.  As I continue to educate myself on building such a site from scratch, I will also build a few projects to nail down the frontend design, as well as basic stie architecture.  So while I'm doing my research, I'll also be working on a few side projects.

The first project will be a static site -- most likely built using React - that will include a menu, an order form, and a home page with details about the business.  Tasks will include layout, a user interface, and style concerns.  The site will be simple, focused on design details and branding.

The second project will be a responsive sitewith a Rails backend that enables my friend, the store owner, to easily update her menus, while also giving customers the ability to set up a store account.  

The third and final project -- a React/Redux site with a Rails backend -- will allow customers to purchase individual items through the site and place orders for catered events.  My client will have access to an "admin" page with a list of registered users, their past purchase history, and options to build and send out newsletters and promotions to these clients.

I'll continue to update the blog with ideas as I build out these projects and explore options for both customers and client in further detail.
